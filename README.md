# About Me
</p>
  I'm Jack Italiano, a CSE Student at The Ohio State University (2021-2024 anticipated). <br />
  I enjoy participating in hackathons, competitive programming competitions, learning new programming concepts, and apply everything I learn in my own projects.

  My repositories include code from Hackathons, Makeathons, course projects, and personal projects.

# My Projects
**Hackathons**
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>2022 Ohio State Make OH/IO competition</i> - 3rd Place (<a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/MakeOhio2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MakeOhio2022</a>): <br />
    This project demonstrates my great improvement in python since the last hackathon (Hack OH/IO) and far better organization of code. I learned all libraries used (OpenCV, PySerial, etc.) during the 24 competition.

  <li>
    <i>2021 Ohio State Hack OH/IO competition</i> (<a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackOhio</a>): <br />
    I had no previous experience in Python and limited experience with JavaScript or any kind of data file (csv, json,  etc.). Everything done in this project, I learned within the 24 hour time frame of the competition.
  </li>
</ul>

We will continue to participate in future Hackathons/Makeathons and hope to win next time.

**Course Projects**
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>Battleship</i> (<a href="https://github.com/italiano16/Battleship" target="_blank" rel="noopener   noreferrer">Battleship</a>): <br/>
    I wrote the entirety of our project for my Engineering 1181 class and received the highest marks of any team in our course. This was my first experience with MATLAB.
  </li>
</ul>

**Personal**
<p>
  My other projects are learning experiences for myself including games and ai.
