# About Me
I'm Jack Italiano, a CSE Student at The Ohio State University graduating in December of 2024.

I enjoy participating in hackathons, competitive programming competitions, learning new programming concepts, and apply everything I learn in my own projects.

My repositories include code from Hackathons, Makeathons, course projects, and personal projects.

Check out my portfolio site [jackitaliano.com](https://jackitaliano.com), which is still a WIP, but interesting none the less. I originally was making something that might fit more in with what a portfolio site "should" be, but found it pretty lackluster and more of the same. I started with the idea of it being a terminal environment, which is more representative of my workflow, but slowly morphed it into a "desktop" experience. 

## My Work Experience
- **NASA Glenn Research**

  I interned at NASA Glenn Research Center as an AI and biomimicry intern for Spring and Summer (Jan - Aug) 2024. My main role was contributing to the development of the open-source [PeTaL Project](https://github.com/nasa-petal).

- **State Farm**

  I worked full-time Summer 2023 with State Farm as a Software Engineering Intern and gained valuable experience with AWS, Terraform, Node.js, and React. I continued with the same team, and I worked part-time through Fall 2023.

- **Holocron Technologies**

  I worked part-time Fall 2022 with Holocron Technologies to research and develop new NLP technologies such as ABSA (aspect based sentiment analysis) models. I wrote entirely in python and got to have my first experience working with a company.


# My Projects
## Hackathons
- [Virtual Therapy](https://github.com/jackitaliano/Hack24) - **The Ohio State Hack OH/IO competition (2024):**
This project was an entirely new experience from our previous hack-a-thon projects. This time we focused on delivering something new, challenging, and technically complex. We delivered a single-camera markerless motion capture system to track both therapists' and patients' movement in a physical therapy setting. This would allow for therapists to simply record an excerise, turn it into a 3D model that animates and presents a new perspective to the patient, and then track how well the patient performs that excercise. Here the technology was the focus rather than the presentation.

- [Stack Farm](https://github.com/Chaseforyourlife/HackDay2023) - **Internal Stack Overflow at State Farm Hack Day (2023):**

  State Farm, who I interned with full-time for Summer 2023 and part-time Fall 2023, hosts a Hack Day similar to the ones I've participated in at The Ohio State University. I participated with a group of fellow interns to create an internal Stack Overflow where employees can post questions they otherwise couldn't post on Stack Overflow due to it's more sensitive/internal nature. I wrote most of the frontend UI in React, which was a great learning experience because it's the most React I've written in a long time!

- [Smart Notes](https://github.com/jackitaliano/Make23) - **The Ohio State Make OH/IO competition (2023):**

  This project is by far my most useful, educational, and involved project yet. I implemented the backend framework using Django, frontend using React, and all operating on a REST Api. I have used React in some compacity previously, but this project has truly evolved my web framework experience in all three. My team and I are continuing to work on this project to deliver a complete product that can be used at colleges across the country.
  
- [Audio Studio Code](https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio2022) - **5th place out of 1,000 participants at The Ohio State Hack OH/IO competition (2022):**

  This project demonstrates my continued improvement of python and my understanding of object oriented programming in general. My portion of the project was a two step pipeline of taking text received from the speech-to-text AI and converting it into python objects that were defined by both line number and by a recursive tree structure. Once they were in object form, they were easily manipulatable and could be edited, moved, checked for scope, etc. and then parsed into proper python syntax using a recursive decent parsing algorithm.
  
- [AI Driver Distraction Detection](https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/MakeOhio2022) - **3rd place out of 80 participants at The Ohio State Make OH/IO competition (2022):**

  This project demonstrates my great improvement in python since the last hackathon (Hack OH/IO) and far better organization of code. I learned all libraries used (OpenCV, PySerial, etc.) during the 24 competition.
    
- [Veeva Data Analysis](https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio) - **The Ohio State Hack OH/IO competition (2021):**

  I had no previous experience in Python and limited experience with JavaScript or any kind of data file (csv, json,  etc.). Everything done in this project, I learned within the 24 hour time frame of the competition.

*We will continue to participate in future Hackathons/Makeathons and hope to win next time.*

## Course Projects
- [The Legend Of Zelda](https://github.com/jackitaliano/LegendOfZelda) - **semester long project course for game development:**

  I worked on a team of four to design and write the software for a 2D game in C# using the XNA and Monogame frameworks. We chose to make the NES version of The Legend of Zelda. We followed agile processes, decided on and implemented design patterns to implement the necessary functionality, and made a great game receiving an A for the project.

- [HydroponiKs](https://github.com/jackitaliano/HydroponiKs) - **selected to present at The Ohio State Engineering Design Showcase:**

  I wrote the entirety of the software for my Engineering 1182 class design project, and our project was chosen as one of the groups to represent our class at the OSU Design Showcase. This was my first experience with Python GUIs (Tkinter)

- [Battleship](https://github.com/jackitaliano/Battleship) - **Engineering 1182 class project:**

  I wrote the entirety of our project for my Engineering 1181 class and received the highest marks of any team in our class. This was my first experience with MATLAB.

## Personal Projects

My other projects are learning experiences for myself including web apps, games, and ai. They have recently been more focused on new LLMs like ChatGPT, which are a lot of fun to try!
