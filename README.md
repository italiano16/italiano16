# About Me
</p>
  I'm Jack Italiano, a CSE Student at The Ohio State University. I anticipate graduating in May 2024 due to being on an accelerated course track.

  My repositories include code from Hackathons, Makeathons, course projects, and personal projects.

# My Projects
<p>
  In March 2022 my team and I won third place in the 2022 Ohio State Make OH/IO competition (<a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/MakeOhio2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MakeOhio2022</a>)</br>
  With the same team I also participated in the 2021 Ohio State Hack OH/IO competition (<a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackOhio2</a>)</br>
  We will continue to participate in future Hackathons/Makeathons and hope to win next time.
</p>

<p>
  For my Engineering 1181 class I wrote the entirety of our project (<a href="https://github.com/italiano16/Battleship" target="_blank" rel="noopener   noreferrer">Battleship</a>) and received the highest marks of any team in our course.
</p>

<p>
  My other projects are learning experiences for myself including games and ai.
