# About Me
</p>
  I'm Jack Italiano, a CSE Student at The Ohio State University (2021-2024 anticipated). <br />
  I enjoy participating in hackathons, competitive programming competitions, learning new programming concepts, and apply everything I learn in my own projects.

  My repositories include code from Hackathons, Makeathons, course projects, and personal projects.

# My Projects
**Hackathons**
<ul>
  <li>
  <b><a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audio Studio Code</a> - 5th place out of 1,000 participants at The Ohio State University Hack OH/IO competition (2022):</b>
  <ul>
    This project demonstrates my continued improvement of python and my understanding of object oriented programming in general. My portion of the project was a two step pipeline of taking text received from the speech-to-text AI and converting it into python objects that were defined by both line number and by a recursive tree structure. Once they were in object form, they were easiily manipulatable and could be edited, moved, checked for scope, etc. and then parsed into proper python syntax.
  </ul> 
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/MakeOhio2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Driver Distraction Detection</a> - 3rd place out of 80 participants at The Ohio State University Make OH/IO competition (2022):</b>
    <ul>
    This project demonstrates my great improvement in python since the last hackathon (Hack OH/IO) and far better organization of code. I learned all libraries used (OpenCV, PySerial, etc.) during the 24 competition.
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veeva Data Analysis</a> - The Ohio State University Hack OH/IO competition (2021):</b>
    <ul>
    I had no previous experience in Python and limited experience with JavaScript or any kind of data file (csv, json,  etc.). Everything done in this project, I learned within the 24 hour time frame of the competition.
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

We will continue to participate in future Hackathons/Makeathons and hope to win next time.

**Course Projects**
<ul>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/jackitaliano/HydroponiKs" target="_blank" rel="noopener   noreferrer"><i>HydroponiKs</i></a> - selected to present at The Ohio State University Engineering Design Showcase:</b>
    <ul>
    I wrote the entirety of the software for my Engineering 1182 class design project, and our project was chosen as one of the groups to represent our class at the OSU Design Showcase. This was my first experience with Python GUIs (Tkinter)
    </ul>
  </i>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/jackitaliano/Battleship" target="_blank" rel="noopener   noreferrer"><i>Battleship</i></a> - Engineering 1182 class project:</b>
  <ul>
    I wrote the entirety of our project for my Engineering 1181 class and received the highest marks of any team in our class. This was my first experience with MATLAB.
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

**Personal**
<p>
  My other projects are learning experiences for myself including games and ai.
