# About Me
</p>
  I'm Jack Italiano, a CSE Student at The Ohio State University (2021-2024 anticipated). <br /><br />
  I enjoy participating in hackathons, competitive programming competitions, learning new programming concepts, and apply everything I learn in my own projects.<br /><br />

  My repositories include code from Hackathons, Makeathons, course projects, and personal projects.

# My Projects
**Hackathons**
<ol>
  <li>
  <b><a href="https://github.com/jackitaliano/Make23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Notes</a> - The Ohio State Make OH/IO competition (2023):</b>
  <ul>
    This project is by far my most useful, educational, and involved project yet. I implemented the backend framework using Django, frontend using React, and all operating on a REST Api. I have used React in some compacity previously, but this project has truly evolved my web framework experience in all three. My team and I are continuing to work on this project to deliver a complete product that can be used at colleges across the country.
  </ul> 
  </li>
  <li>
  <b><a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audio Studio Code</a> - 5th place out of 1,000 participants at The Ohio State Hack OH/IO competition (2022):</b>
  <ul>
    This project demonstrates my continued improvement of python and my understanding of object oriented programming in general. My portion of the project was a two step pipeline of taking text received from the speech-to-text AI and converting it into python objects that were defined by both line number and by a recursive tree structure. Once they were in object form, they were easily manipulatable and could be edited, moved, checked for scope, etc. and then parsed into proper python syntax using a recursive decent parsing algorithm.
  </ul> 
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/MakeOhio2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Driver Distraction Detection</a> - 3rd place out of 80 participants at The Ohio State Make OH/IO competition (2022):</b>
    <ul>
    This project demonstrates my great improvement in python since the last hackathon (Hack OH/IO) and far better organization of code. I learned all libraries used (OpenCV, PySerial, etc.) during the 24 competition.
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veeva Data Analysis</a> - The Ohio State Hack OH/IO competition (2021):</b>
    <ul>
    I had no previous experience in Python and limited experience with JavaScript or any kind of data file (csv, json,  etc.). Everything done in this project, I learned within the 24 hour time frame of the competition.
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

We will continue to participate in future Hackathons/Makeathons and hope to win next time.

**Course Projects**
<ul>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/jackitaliano/LegendOfZelda" target="_blank" rel="noopener   noreferrer"><i>The Legend Of Zelda</i></a> - semester long project course for game development:</b>
    <ul>
    I worked on a team of four to design and write the software for a 2D game in C# using the XNA and Monogame frameworks. We chose to make the NES version of The Legend of Zelda. We followed agile processes, decided on and implemented design patterns to implement the necessary functionality, and made a great game receiving an A for the project.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/jackitaliano/HydroponiKs" target="_blank" rel="noopener   noreferrer"><i>HydroponiKs</i></a> - selected to present at The Ohio State Engineering Design Showcase:</b>
    <ul>
    I wrote the entirety of the software for my Engineering 1182 class design project, and our project was chosen as one of the groups to represent our class at the OSU Design Showcase. This was my first experience with Python GUIs (Tkinter)
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/jackitaliano/Battleship" target="_blank" rel="noopener   noreferrer"><i>Battleship</i></a> - Engineering 1182 class project:</b>
  <ul>
    I wrote the entirety of our project for my Engineering 1181 class and received the highest marks of any team in our class. This was my first experience with MATLAB.
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

**Personal**
<p>
  My other projects are learning experiences for myself including web apps, games, and ai.
