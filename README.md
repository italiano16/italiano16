I'm Jack Italiano, a CSE Student at The Ohio State University. I anticipate graduating in May 2024 due to being on an accelerated course track.

My repositories include code from Hackathons, Makeathons, course projects, and personal projects.

In March 2022 my team and I won third place in the 2022 Ohio State Make OH/IO competition (<a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/MakeOhio2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MakeOhio2022</a>)
With the same team I also participated in the 2021 Ohio State Hack OH/IO competition (<a href="https://github.com/rahulmedicharla/HackOhio2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackOhio2</a>)
We will continue to participate in future Hackathons/Makeathons and hope to win next time.

For my Engineering 1181 class I wrote the entirety of our project (<a href="https://github.com/italiano16/Battleship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battleship</a>) and received the highest marks of any team in our course.

My other projects are learning experiences for myself including games and ai.
